# Amsterdam Geospatial Data Acquisition

This repository contains my submission for the Data Acquisition exercise for Geospatial Data Consulting.

## ✅ Deliverables

- `presentation_amsterdam.pdf`: A short 8-slide summary of the process
- `data/`: Local geospatial datasets in GPKG format:
  - Building height dataset (footprint level)
  - Land-use dataset with 10+ categories


## ℹ️ Notes

Only the city of **Amsterdam** was completed due to time constraints.
All data sources are local and processed in QGIS.
